This project is supposed to solve one thing and one thing only: to bundle all those micro-methods one tends to take from one project to the other with little to no changes, including and using them again and again.

Why do we do this? Because using a full-blown framework for such small tasks is complete overkill and we don't got the nerves to learn special ways of bindings and syntax just to validate an eMail-address.

Soooo, this where ToolBox comes to the rescue. A small, compact solution-framework, without any exotic syntax and, most important, auto-inclusion of just the parts that are used, without the need to include anything manually apart from the main-class.
